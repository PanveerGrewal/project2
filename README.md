## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code uses the `turtle` module, which is included with Python by default.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code.
2. Open the Python script using your preferred Python environment (e.g., IDLE, VS Code, or a Jupyter Notebook).
3. Run the script to see the complex hut and landscape drawn on the screen.

## Usage

The code defines functions to draw rectangles, triangles, and flowers. Here's an overview of the main elements in the code:

- The ground and the sun are drawn as the background of the landscape.
- The hut consists of a base, a roof, and a door.
- Flowers are drawn with brown stems and green leaves.

You can customize the code by modifying colors, and dimensions, or adding more elements to the landscape.

## I want to express my commitment to delivering a higher-quality project. Regrettably, I've been grappling with health issues and the added pressure of midterm exams in other subjects. so I'm unable to give the expected time to this project.  I assure you that I'm not using this as an excuse, but rather as an explanation of my current circumstances. I am sincerely grateful for your understanding in this time.
